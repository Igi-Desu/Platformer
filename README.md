# Platformer
Simple platformer game made using unity
In this project I was using assets from unity store : [LINK](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/sunny-land-103349#description)

I've implemented some mechanics like coyote jump, wall jumping, simple dialogue system and cutscenes.
I've also tried my hand on making music.
